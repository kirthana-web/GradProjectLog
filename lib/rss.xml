Headaches (Migraine, Cluster &amp; TTH) , Podiatry<br>
Headaches and Podiatry are fields that are not completely understood and that often surfaces in being able to prescribe appropriate treatment (big claim). In the given state of these medical conditions, are there possibilities of certain tools existing that could help alleviate pain faced by individuals living with it?<br>//Pain Vocabulary<br>
Appropriate descriptions and correlations with other indicators could lead to appropriate diagnosis and treatment.

Is there a need / ways that could evolve into tools to improve the capacity of describing and expressing pain (to improve ability to diagnose)?<br>//Biofeedback<br>

Improving/Augmenting observational capabilities <br>Also re-found a few areas of interest, <br>Curiosity as a behaviour, how can it be leveraged in the context of learning?<br>
How might we enable play in the phygital medium?<br>
What does play-led interaction design look like?<br>Areas that might or could possibly converge,<br>
<br>Physical Intelligence + Fitness/Rehab + Observational Capacity
<br>Curiosity + Phygital Play + Play-led IxD
<br>Supposed first-leg: <br>
<br>Begin interacting with people on both the fronts (Designers and Educators for what enables curiosity, People in the fitness industry for physical intelligence)
<br>First-Aid - Get in touch with paramedics
<br>GP updates <br>1.	Neurology Front: Call (Space of Migraine care/TTH care (diagnostics, everyday life, pain management upon episode, difference between episodic and chronic, understood and accepted pathophysiology: Philosophy of where I’m coming from, to improve patient outcomes at whatever capacity possible) 

2.	What worries you? : (Activity as a means of discovering areas to work with, general gathering and probing and grouping to see if patterns emerge) 

3.	Developing Interactions for Designers: Tactile, Haptic, Motion, Audio. In what ways can designing for these senses be made easier? Are we designing a tool? A means to a tool? What are we implicating? Do products like this exist? Is this experimental or catered as a product offering to designers?

4.	Play through hardware: Is there a way to make making phygital interactions easier? Is there a way to develop tools that can enable faster making of games and other interactions that could A. Inform design practice B. Improve or expand existing modalities of play

 <br>Area of Work: Physical Wellbeing <br>Specificities: Forefront-ing physical intelligence at the junctures of injury-recovery cycles, certain chronic conditions, elderly care and general wellbeing.<br>Core Belief: Physical intelligence (PI) is the ability of the body's technology to function and adapt in the physical world. Leveraging understanding of &amp; targeted training/evaluating PI could prove to be beneficial in specific contexts.<br>From the neuroscience perspective,<br>
PI is the result of cognitive capabilities, biological information processing and biomechanics working in tandem. <br>From the psychology-arts perspective,<br>
PI is the means through which we interact and navigate the physical world. <br>From the embodied AI perspective,<br>
PI is the combination of visual perception, workflow planning and causal models. <br>From the physical wellbeing perspective,<br>
PI is composed of proprioceptive abilities, strength &amp; mobility, reflex &amp; coordination.<br>Primary Hope: Improve quality of physical assessments, recovery &amp; monitoring biomechanical and cognitive functions.<br>Secondary Hope: Improve capacity to identify cognitive &amp; biomechanical decline early on, reduce risk of injury in routine tasks &amp; identify potential developmental challenges relating to motor-skills and mobility.<br>Tertiary Hope: Improve overall motivation quotient for wellbeing. <br>Things to do: <br>Relevant Stakeholders: Conversation/Interviews <br>
<br>Identify what it means to individuals to stay fit 
<br>Core motivations and their sources to stay fit/healthy
<br>Physiotherapists, Orthopedics, Geriatric Care Centers, Child Developmental Care Centers

 <br>Focus:<br>
Physical Intelligence: A set of abilities and capacities that utilise technology of the physical body to interact with the world in a versatile and resilient manner.<br>
Physical Wellbeing: The means through which physical intelligence is leveraged.<br>Groups of people to whom leveraging physical intelligence can be critical: <br>
<br>Children aged 3 - 12 : Can fully understand what the human body is capable of while building their roots in listening to their body, and developing best practices in physical wellbeing through play
<br>Older Adults 55 - 65: Can understand and monitor their physical capacities over time to be able to identify early indicators of biomechanical development of a disorder, improve health outcomes by minimising friction to being physically active
<br>Individuals who have suffered an injury: Can augment abilities to monitor changes over time, understand recovery and progress. 
<br>Approach: <br>
<br>Behavioural Layer: Core motivations of individuals in relation to physical wellbeing
<br>Experiential / Functional needs: People &amp; Experts (Physiotherapists, Geriatric Care Specialists, Child Developmental Centers)
